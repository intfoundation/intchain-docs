# Introduction

The `intchain` executable program is the entry point for running an INT Chain node. 
All the validator nodes and full nodes need to install the `intchain` and launching the daemon to join the INT Chain network. 
You can also use `intchain` to start your own test network locally.

## Hardware Requeirment

It's recommended that you run INT Chain nodes on Linux Server.

### Minimum Requirement

- 4 CPU
- Memory: 8GB
- Disk: 512GB SSD
- OS: CentOS 7.5 64-bit
- Bandwidth: 20Mbps
- Allow all incoming connections on TCP port 8550 and 8555

## Home Directory

The home directory is the working directory of the INT Chain node. The home directory contains all the configuration information and all the data of node.

In the `intchain` command, you can specify the home directory of the node by using flag `--datadir`. 
If you run multiple nodes on the same machine, you need to specify different home directories for them. 
If the `--datadir` flag is not specified in the INT Chain command, the default value `$HOME/.intchain` is used as the home directory.

The `intchain init-intchain` and `intchain init` command is responsible for initializing the specified `--datadir` directory and creating the default configuration files. 
Except the `intchain init-intchain` command, the home directory used by any other `intchain` sub commands must be initialized, otherwise an error will be reported.

The data of the intchain node is stored in the `nodes` directory of the home, blockchain data is stored in the `<datadir>/<chainid>/intchain`.


### genesis.json

genesis.json defines the consensus data, which specifies the system parameters such as chain_id, consensus parameters, creation of validators. 
See [genesis-file](../concepts/3-genesis-file.md) for details.


### int_genesis.json

int_genesis.json defines the genesis block data, which specifies the system parameters such as chain_id, the initial account token allocation. 
See [int-genesis-file](../concepts/3-genesis-file.md) for details.


### nodekey

nodekey is used to store the node's key, which is used to indicate the unique identity of the node. It is used in p2p connection.

### priv_validator.json

priv_validator.json is the file that the validator will use to sign Pre-vote/Pre-commit in each round of consensus voting. 
As the consensus progresses, the IPBFT consensus engine will continuously update `last_height`/`last_round`/ `last_step` values.
